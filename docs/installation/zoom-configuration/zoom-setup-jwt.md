# Zoom Setup \(JWT\)



1. Set the **API Key** and **API Secret**, generated by Zoom and used to create meetings and pull user data:
   * Go to [https://marketplace.zoom.us](https://marketplace.zoom.us) and log in.
   * In the top left click on **Develop** and then **Build App**.
   * Enter a name for your app and disable **Intend to publish this app on Zoom Marketplace**.
   * Choose **Account-level app** as the app type.
   * Select **JWT API Credentials** as authentication type.
   * Click **Create**.
   * Enter the **Company Name** and **Developer Contact Information** for your app.
   * Go to the **App Credentials** tab on the left. Here you'll find your **API Key** and **API Secret**.
   * Paste the **API Key** and **API Secret** into the fields in the Mattermost System Console, and hit **Save**.

To generate an **API Key** and **API Secret** requires a [Pro, Business, Education, or API Zoom plan](https://zoom.us/pricing).

{% hint style="info" %}
Users will need to sign-up for their own Zoom account using the same email address that they use for Mattermost. If the user attempts to start a Zoom meeting without a Zoom account, they will see the following error message: "We could not verify your Mattermost account in Zoom. Please ensure that your Mattermost email address matches your Zoom email address." In addition, the user must be added to the admin's Zoom account to quickly start a meeting without having to share a personal meeting ID.

## Configure Webhook Events

When a meeting finishes in Zoom, the original link shared in the channel can be changed to indicate the meeting has ended and how long it lasted.  To enable this functionality, we need to create a webhook subscription in Zoom that tells the mattermost server every time a meeting ends, then Mattermost can update the original Zoom message. 

* Click "Add New Event Subscription" and call it "Meeting Ended"
* Select "All Users in the account"
* The notification endpoint URL should be copied from the Zoom configuration page at the very bottom in this format \(substitute the webhook secret you generated on this screen\): [https://SITEURL/plugins/zoom/webhook?secret=WEBHOOKSECRET](https://SITEURL/plugins/zoom/webhook?secret=WEBHOOKSECRET)
