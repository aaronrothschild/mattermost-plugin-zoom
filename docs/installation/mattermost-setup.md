# Mattermost Setup

## Zoom Plugin Setup Guide

{% hint style="info" %}
You will need a paid Zoom account to use the plugin.
{% endhint %}

1. Go to **System Console &gt; Plugins &gt; Zoom** to configure the Zoom Plugin. \(see below example\)
2. How are you hosting Zoom?
   1. **Self Hosted?**

      If you're using a self-hosted private cloud or on-premise Zoom server, enter the **Zoom URL** and **Zoom API URL** for the Zoom server, for example `https://yourzoom.com` and `https://api.yourzoom.com/v2` respectively. Leave blank if you're using Zoom's vendor-hosted SaaS service.

   2. **Cloud Hosted?**

      Simply leave `Zoom API URL` and `Zoom URL` fields blank 
3. Continue to the next section - [Zoom Configuration](zoom-configuration/) - you'll then return to this screen and enter some information you've gathered from Zoom to continue the configuration.
