# Install Zoom Plugin

### Install via Plugin Marketplace \(Recommended\)

1. Go to **Main Menu &gt; Plugin** Marketplace in Mattermost
2. Search for "Zoom" or manually find the plugin from the list and click **Install**
3. After the plugin has downloaded and been installed, click the **Configure** button
4. Generate a **Secret** for `Webhook Secret` and `Stats API Secret`
5. Go to the top of the screen and set **Enable Plugin** to `True`and then click **Save** to enable the Zoom plugin.

### \(Alternative\) Install via Manual Upload

If your server doesn't have access to the internet, you can download the [latest plugin binary release](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-zoom/releases) and upload it to your server via **System Console &gt; Plugin Management.** The binary releases on the page above, are the same as used by the Marketplace.
